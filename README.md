Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Description:
Objective of this project is to predict the stock price using Machine learning algorithm. The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and it contains some historical data of Tesla stock. Data set link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timoboz/tesla-stock-data-from-2010-to-2020. I have used the following libraries for this project:
- Numpy: Used for performing basic calculations
- Pandas: Used to handle dataframes and arrays
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for data visulization
- XGBoost: Used for Gradient descent
